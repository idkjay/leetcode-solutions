# Length of Last Word
```
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
```

## Solution 1
```
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
     return s.trim().split(" ").pop().length;
};
```

## Explanation:
```
1. .trim removes whitespace from both sides of a string.
2. .split(" ") will split the string into an array of substrings based off of (" ")
3. Then we just pop off the last word in the array and return the length of is.
```
