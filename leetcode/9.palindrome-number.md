# 9. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrom. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same way backwards as forward. Try to solve it without converting the integer to a string.

Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Solution: 
```
var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    if (x < 0) return false;

    const reverse = `${x}`.split('').reverse().join('');

    return x == reverse;
};
```

## Explanation
```
1. Negative numbers can't be palindromes because the negative sign will pop up at the back. This if logic will return false if the number in the function is negative.
2. Using string interpolation/template literals, we can split, reverse, and join the x variable without actually turning it into a string first because we are actually working with the string representation of x. 
3. Return a boolean, comparing x with our reversed representation of x using double equals. Double equals will compare the value regardless of types.
```

## Solution 2:
```
var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    let testCase = x + '';

    for(let i = 0; i < testCase.length/2; i++) {
        if(testCase[i] !== testCase[testCase.length - i - 1]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
